    # TODO(Lukepfeiffer): I think a good strategy is to pull the image from the camera and store it locally
    # on the computer. Delete once a new frame is grabbed for the same camera. If we name image files
    # under a convention this will be trivial. Reduces overhead for storing images in our DB
